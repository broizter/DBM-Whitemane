## Download
Latest release version can always be downloaded with [THIS](https://github.com/broizter/DBM-Whitemane/releases/latest/download/DBM-Whitemane.zip) link. If you instead choose to download the code directly you will get more recent changes but at a higher risk of bugs.  

## Bugs and questions  
When you find timers or other things that are incorrect please create a [bug report](https://github.com/broizter/DBM-Whitemane/issues/new/choose) and attach any video recordings or [Transcriptor](https://github.com/Zidras/Transcriptor-WOTLK) logs so that it's easier for me to fix them.
